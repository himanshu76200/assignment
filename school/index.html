            <h4>Alpha Bio Club</h4>
            <p>Alpha Bio Cell is a group of like-minded individuals with complementing skill sets coming together to
                inculcate
                entrepreneurship skills in aspiring bio entrepreneurs. It is a team of raw minds, wanting to tap into
                the untapped
                potential that a bio based entrepreneurship venture could offer. We believe that Biology being the study
                of life should
                not be confined just to the laboratory but also be allowed to spread its wings to influence the other
                parts of the
                industry. It serves as an opportunity to grow and develop into skilled individuals not only obtaining
                knowledge and
                hands-on experience from the laboratory but also from business endeavours. Alpha Bio Cell is an
                initiative to nurture
                leadership so that bio-entrepreneurs would not only lead in the scientific arena but also in the
                corporate world.</p>

                be talking about today, but the thought that you channel inside you and follow your heart. You can only
                do well if you
                lead your soul, your passion with sheer determination, so that when the time comes you do what you can
                and dazzle us
                with the skills you had acquired throughout. Club organizes workshop in different areas of animation.
